/**
 * Given a list of folders folder, return the folders after removing all sub-folders in those folders. You may return the answer in any order.
 *
 * If a folder[i] is located within another folder[j], it is called a sub-folder of it. A sub-folder of folder[j] must start with folder[j], followed by a "/". For example, "/a/b" is a sub-folder of "/a", but "/b" is not a sub-folder of "/a/b/c".
 *
 * The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: '/' followed by one or more lowercase English letters.
 *
 * For example, "/leetcode" and "/leetcode/problems" are valid paths while an empty string and "/" are not.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]
 * Output: ["/a","/c/d","/c/f"]
 * Explanation: Folders "/a/b" is a subfolder of "/a" and "/c/d/e" is inside of folder "/c/d" in our filesystem.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b/c","/a/b/d"]
 * Output: ["/a"]
 * Explanation: Folders "/a/b/c" and "/a/b/d" will be removed because they are subfolders of "/a".
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: folder = ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
 * Output: ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= folder.length <= 4 * 104
 * 2 <= folder[i].length <= 100
 * folder[i] contains only lowercase letters and '/'.
 * folder[i] always starts with the character '/'.
 * Each folder name is unique.
